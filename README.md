# LayoutSections

This repo demonstrates how to use sections with Blazor.

## Prerequsites 

- ASP.NET 8 Preview 5
- Telerik UI for Blazor
- Visual Stuido 2022 Preview

## Notes

Samples contain layouts defined with both CSS and TelerikGridLayout. To switch between the two styles of layout, open `App.razor` and change the using statement for the desired layout type.

If you have a licensed copy of Telerik UI for Blazor, remove the word `Trial` from the Telerik dependencies.
